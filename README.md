# Interpolating-Polynomials-Vandermonde-Project2
The key difference between this project and Interpolating-Polynomials-Project2 is the implementation of the direct method.  In this method I solve for the coefficients of the interpolating polynomial using the Vandermonde matrix.  In the previous version I simply plot the data points.
